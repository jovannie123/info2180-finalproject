# info2180-finalproject

This is the final project for Jeron Burnett, Akele Benjamin

I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT Javaur Gassop and Rivaldo Reid NOT GET ANY GRADE FOR THIS PROJECT AS THEY BASICALLY DID NOTHING TO HELP WITH THE PROJECT

Javaur Gassop and Rivaldo Reid shound have been apart of the grou, but they did not do anything to contribute to the final submissions since the codes they did did not work and they did not fix, so Akele Benjamin had to do over all that they did. 

I uploaded the code that akele did along with mine in noBug branch. and this is what will be merged with main for the final submission.
